## Introduction

The COVID-19 virus, first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020. Research on coronaviruses dates back to 1965, highlighting the respiratory nature of the B814 virus and its potential for human transmission.

This pandemic underscores the critical role of vaccinations, informed by historical successes against infectious diseases. Modern strategies include rigorous epidemiological modeling, such as the SIR (Susceptible, Infectious, Removed) model, initially applied during London's Black Death by Kermack and McKendrick, which segments the population based on disease exposure and recovery statuses.

Recent enhancements to the SIR model incorporate network theory and varying infection dynamics, allowing for nuanced understanding and effective disease control strategies. These models prioritize timely interventions, like vaccination and isolation, to mitigate disease spread, supported by both theoretical and computational studies.

Such mathematical frameworks are not only pivotal for managing current epidemics like COVID-19 but also for planning future public health responses.

## Theoretical Basis

The agent-based model presented here is an extension of the SIR model, and based on the article "A Restricted SIR Model with Vaccination Effect for the Epidemic Outbreaks Concerning COVID-19" by Ibtehal Alazman, Kholoud Saad Albalawi, Pranay Goswami2, and Kuldeep Malik. The new model focuses on two main concepts: first, it can present multiple waves of the disease, and second, it analyzes how far an infection can be eradicated with the help of vaccination.

### Code Snippets and its Explanation

<br />

#### Birth Rate

We have a variable input `annual_birth_per_1000` which is used to calculate the birth rate. The birth rate is calculated by multiplying the number of turtles with the birth rate per 1000 per year and dividing it by 1000. The rate is then calculated by dividing the product by 365. We then ask one of the turtles to check if the random float is less than the rate. If it is, the status of the turtle is set to "S" and the birth count is incremented by 1.

```javascript
to handle_birth_rate
  let rate (count turtles * (annual_birth_per_1000 / 1000)) / 365

  ifelse random-float 100.0 < rate
  [
    set birth_count birth_count + 1
    create-turtles 1
    [
      setxy random-xcor random-ycor
      set shape "person"
      set status "S"
    ]
  ]
  []
end
```

<br />

#### Death Rate

We have a variable input `annual_death_per_1000` which is used to calculate the death rate. The death rate is calculated by multiplying the number of turtles with the death rate per 1000 per year and dividing it by 1000. The rate is then calculated by dividing the product by 365. We then ask one of the turtles to check if the random float is less than the rate. If it is, the status of the turtle is set to "D" and the natural death count is incremented by 1.

```javascript
to handle_death_rate
  let rate (count turtles * (annual_death_per_1000 / 1000)) / 365

  ask one-of turtles [
    if random-float 100.0 < rate
    [
      set status "D"
      set natural_death_count natural_death_count + 1
    ]
  ]
end
```

<br />

#### Infection Rate

We have a variable input `infection_rate` which is used to calculate the infection rate. We then ask the other turtles in the radius of 1 with the status "S" to check if the random float is less than the infection rate. If it is, the status of the turtle is set to "I".

```javascript
to spread
  let chance random-float 100

  ask other turtles in-radius 1 with [status = "S"] [
    if chance < infection_rate [
      set status "I"
    ]
  ]
end
```

<br />

#### Recovery Rate

We have a variable input `recovery_rate` which is used to calculate the recovery rate. We then ask the turtle to check if the random float is less than the recovery rate. If it is, the status of the turtle is set to "R".

```javascript
to recover_or_die
  if infectious_time > days_until_death [
    set status "D"
    set died_from_covid_count died_from_covid_count + 1
  ]

  if status != "D" and infectious_time > days_to_be_recoverable [
    if random-float 100 < recovery_rate [
      set status "R"
      set infectious_time 0
      set start_of_susceptability days_to_be_susceptible
    ]
  ]
end
```
