## Introduction

The COVID-19 virus, first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020. Research on coronaviruses dates back to 1965, highlighting the respiratory nature of the B814 virus and its potential for human transmission.

This pandemic underscores the critical role of vaccinations, informed by historical successes against infectious diseases. Modern strategies include rigorous epidemiological modeling, such as the SIR (Susceptible, Infectious, Removed) model, initially applied during London's Black Death by Kermack and McKendrick, which segments the population based on disease exposure and recovery statuses.

Recent enhancements to the SIR model incorporate network theory and varying infection dynamics, allowing for nuanced understanding and effective disease control strategies. These models prioritize timely interventions, like vaccination and isolation, to mitigate disease spread, supported by both theoretical and computational studies.

Such mathematical frameworks are not only pivotal for managing current epidemics like COVID-19 but also for planning future public health responses.

## Theoretical Basis

The agent-based model presented here is an extension of the SIR model, and based on the article "A Restricted SIR Model with Vaccination Effect for the Epidemic Outbreaks Concerning COVID-19" by Ibtehal Alazman, Kholoud Saad Albalawi, Pranay Goswami2, and Kuldeep Malik. The new model focuses on two main concepts: first, it can present multiple waves of the disease, and second, it analyzes how far an infection can be eradicated with the help of vaccination.
